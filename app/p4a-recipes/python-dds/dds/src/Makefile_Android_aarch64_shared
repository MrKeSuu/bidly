# --------------------- INFORMATION --------------------------------

# This the DDS Makefile for Android and the compiler from NDK 25b.
# It creates a dynamically linked (shared) library, libdds.so.

# --------------------- CONFIGURATION ------------------------------

# You can configure the following:

# 1. The threading systems that you want in the library.
# You will always get single-threading.  If you have multiple
# threading systems, the default will be the multi-threading one
# with the lowest number (see System.cpp).  All that matters is
# CC_THREADING.

# GCD and WINAPI don't work on Windows.
THR_BOOST	= -DDDS_THREADS_BOOST
THR_GCD		= -DDDS_THREADS_GCD
THR_OPENMP	= -DDDS_THREADS_OPENMP
THR_WINAPI	= -DDDS_THREADS_WINAPI
THR_STL		= -DDDS_THREADS_STL

THREADING	= ${THR_OPENMP}

# If you need to add something for a threading system, this is
# the place.

CC_BOOST_LINK	= -lboost_system -lboost_thread

THREAD_COMPILE	= -fopenmp
THREAD_LINK	= -fopenmp

# 2. Debugging options.  (There are more granular options in debug.h.)

DEBUG_ALL	= -DDDS_DEBUG_ALL 
TIMING		= -DDDS_TIMING
SCHEDULER	= -DDDS_SCHEDULER

# All that matters from no. 2 and no. 3 is the following.  Here you
# can add $(SMALL_MEMORY) etc.

DDS_BEHAVIOR	=

# ----------------------- OFTEN OK    ------------------------------

# From here on you you don't have to change anything to CONFIGURE
# the compilation.  But you may well have to change something to 
# get it to compile.

INCL_SOURCE	= sources.txt
INCL_DEPENDS	= depends_o.txt

# If your compiler name is not given here, change it.

# We compile with aggressive warnings, but we have to turn off some
# of them as they appear in libraries in great numbers...
